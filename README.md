## Write Better Python

This is the home page for Mats Wichmann Consulting. I've decided to use it to jot down some thoughts and discoveries in the Python programming language, which is where I spend a lot of my time.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mwichmann/mdwweb/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mwichmann/mdwweb/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
